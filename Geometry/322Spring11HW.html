<p align="left"><b><font size="4">First &quot;Assignment&quot;</font></b>:&nbsp; Email me 
at <a href="mailto:nscoville@ursinus.edu">nscoville@ursinus.edu</a> with 
answerers to the following questions:</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
1.&nbsp; Why are you taking this course?</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
2.&nbsp; What do you want to get out of this course?&nbsp; Any specific material 
you would like to see?&nbsp; (Perhaps you have heard that this course covers X 
or will be helpful for your major in Y because you will learn about Z, a concept 
very important in the study of Y)</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
3.&nbsp; What math courses have you taken before?&nbsp; What courses do you plan 
to take in the future?</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
4.&nbsp; What is your major and minor?</p>
<p align="left">&quot;I don't know&quot; and &quot;because it is required&quot; are perfectly valid 
answerers.&nbsp; Write as much or as little to each answer as you would like me 
to know.&nbsp; Do not feel that you have to make something up that sounds good 
to satisfy me as there is nothing wrong with answering &quot;I'm not sure.&quot;</p>

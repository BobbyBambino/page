<span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%">Guidelines for Calculus Writing 
Project</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="line-height: 115%">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="line-height: 115%">You are to write a paper on 
a calculus topic of your choosing (one not directly covered in class) which 
discusses mathematics of your topic in both symbols (equations, formulas, etc.) 
and words.&nbsp; The purpose of this paper for you to 1) discover and learn some 
mathematics totally on your own&nbsp; 2) get you to write about mathematics as 
opposed to simply doing plug-and-chug 3) provide an opportunity to explore some 
facet of math that may be pertinent to you in the future.&nbsp; You must propose a 
topic to me no later than <b>Thursday October 24.&nbsp; </b>The paper will be due on 
Thursday November 11.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="line-height: 115%">How to choose a topic:&nbsp;
</span></b><span style="line-height: 115%">The easiest way to choose a topic is 
to choose to write about a section that we do not plan to cover in the book and 
which was not covered in Calculus I.&nbsp; Try to choose a topic that may be relevant 
to your chosen major or field.&nbsp; For example, section 8.2 concerns “Fluid 
Pressure and Force” which is of interest to many people in a variety of areas of 
science.&nbsp; Of course, you are not limited to calculus topics which are only found 
in the text.&nbsp; Perhaps you are a secondary education major and are interested in 
how students study calculus for the AP exam.&nbsp; You can look up studies about that 
topic and write about that.&nbsp; Or if you are interested in history, you may write 
about some aspect of the history of the development of the calculus.&nbsp; </span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="line-height: 115%">Grading:&nbsp; </span></b>
<span style="line-height: 115%">I am breaking up the grading into two very broad 
categories each worth 50 points.&nbsp; You will be graded on 1) your understanding of 
the math and 2) the coherence and writing in your paper.&nbsp; All things “math 
related” fall into category 1.&nbsp; Category 2 deals with small things like 
punctuation, sentence structure, capitalization, etc. but it also deals with 
global things like whether or not the paper is well written and readable, 
layout, presentation, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="line-height: 115%">Requirements and Advice:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="text-indent: -.25in">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%">Cite your sources.&nbsp; It is okay to 
take certain formulas or theorems as true without deriving them yourself in your 
paper, but if you do, you must cite a source which does go through the necessary 
math to arrive at your formula (or theorem or whatever).&nbsp; If you make a factual 
claim, you need to have a source for where this claim can be found.&nbsp; This is a 
necessary component in the broader world of scholarship, not just math, so it is 
important that you are careful about checking your facts for yourself as well as 
giving the reader a reliable reference.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent: -.25in">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%">Use proper punctuation.&nbsp; 
Mathematical equations and formulas can be parts of English sentences.&nbsp; Hence 
proper punctuation is required.&nbsp; If you wish to take the derivative of x<sup>2</sup>, 
then the following is appropriate:</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span style="line-height: 115%">Let f(x)=x<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp; 
Then f’(x)=2x.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span style="line-height: 115%">Notice 
that the second sentence reads “f prime of x is equal to two x” and that it is 
indeed an English sentence requiring a period at the end.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent: -.25in">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%">Aim for roughly 3-5 typed, 
double-spaced pages.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent: -.25in">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%">If you are finding that typing 
math into Microsoft word is cumbersome, there is a program known as LaTeX which 
is designed for writing math (and other science) papers.&nbsp; This is the standard 
software that all mathematicians use to write mathematical papers.&nbsp; It is free 
to download, extremely easy to learn, and produces very beautiful documents.&nbsp; If 
you are interested in using this program, please see me and I can help you get 
started.&nbsp; In fact, those of you who are planning to take more math courses may 
wish to learn LaTeX now because you will find that it is much easier and neater 
to type your homework on than writing it by hand.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="text-indent: -.25in">
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%">Mathematical writing is not 
poetry, but that does not mean it must be completely technical, dry, monotonous, 
or devoid of all humanness.&nbsp; You are writing to another human being in an 
attempt to explain a certain concept.&nbsp; While formulas and symbols are often 
helpful, there is nothing wrong with including (in addition to necessary 
technical points and formulas) an explanation of what is going on or what you 
are trying to do in an informal or intuitive way.&nbsp; Think about the definition of 
the derivative.&nbsp; It is totally unclear what the limit formula is trying to do if 
you simply give it to someone as a definition, but if you explain where it comes 
from or why the definition is the way it is in words or pictures, the concept is 
much clearer to the reader.</span></p>
